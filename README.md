# More Tribute, More Hatred 

Good ol hardy individuals have a right to hate and fight for the right to say it, too. 
Socialists already take hating for granted.

Another case of seeking justice against institutions, against two religions in this one.

After they made him outcast, they decided it was best to drown the airwaves. He must have 
overheard their plan to keep killing him softly.

Forget Alien vs. Predator. Not realistic enough. Try this one... Cowboy vs. Skinhead. I'm surprised 
Hollywood hasn't made a movie out of the concept yet.
