# More Tribute, More Hatred 

Good ol hardy individuals have a right to hate and fight for the right to say it, too. 
Socialists already take hating for granted.

Another case of seeking justice against institutions, against two religions in this one.

After they made him outcast, they decided it was best to drown the airwaves. He must have 
overheard their plan to keep killing him softly.

Forget Alien vs. Predator. Not realistic enough. Try this one... Cowboy vs. Skinhead. I'm surprised 
Hollywood hasn't made a movie out of the concept yet.

Those that have never met God but have met goddesses, and maybe that is why. And it's definitely not a narco-terrorist 
conspiracy. Legal doctor. Good doctor.

Talk is so cheap, isn't it? Like, so what? He's in debt to the doctor and doesn't want to pay up. It's not like he has 
any way to solve this human problem. He is bluffing. He is so bluffing.

That's very typical. If you were a kid, it would come as a shock to you the great lengths people go. It looks like this 
man intends for the two to go to greater lengths, to hell.

A helping hand that surely comes is from an owner that wanted to extend that hand. Once the "real world" hits, no one 
really respects or pays anything more than what they have, anyways.

How cogent and strategic. And such beautiful words too, only because it came from a beautiful woman. You know...you know 
how that goes. Reconstruction. Deconstruction. All in one day.

Well, it's not wrong to imagine this. Plenty of low-quality TV shows for example. How do you say, network effect? Legal dramatization? 
De la boca, zu die lieben.

Such humility. Seldom goes unpunished. And it's not as if what he's saying is true. He's probably just a pessimist. And that's why 
he's not rich. Reason.
