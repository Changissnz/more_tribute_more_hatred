# More Tribute, More Hatred 

Good ol hardy individuals have a right to hate and fight for the right to say it, too. 
Socialists already take hating for granted. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Another case of seeking justice against institutions, against two religions in this one.

After they made him outcast, they decided it was best to drown the airwaves. He must have 
overheard their plan to keep killing him softly.

Forget Alien vs. Predator. Not realistic enough. Try this one... Cowboy vs. Skinhead. I'm surprised 
Hollywood hasn't made a movie out of the concept yet.

Those that have never met God but have met goddesses, and maybe that is why. And it's definitely not a narco-terrorist 
conspiracy. Legal doctor. Good doctor.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

Talk is so cheap, isn't it? Like, so what? He's in debt to the doctor and doesn't want to pay up. It's not like he has 
any way to solve this human problem. He is bluffing. He is so bluffing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

That's very typical. If you were a kid, it would come as a shock to you the great lengths people go. It looks like this 
man intends for the two to go to greater lengths, to hell.

A helping hand that surely comes is from an owner that wanted to extend that hand. Once the "real world" hits, no one 
really respects or pays anything more than what they have, anyways.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

How cogent and strategic. And such beautiful words too, only because it came from a beautiful woman. You know...you know 
how that goes. Reconstruction. Deconstruction. All in one day.

Well, it's not wrong to imagine this. Plenty of low-quality TV shows for example. How do you say, network effect? Legal dramatization? 
De la boca, zu die lieben.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

Such humility. Seldom goes unpunished. And it's not as if what he's saying is true. He's probably just a pessimist. And that's why 
he's not rich. Reason.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

It is big decisions like these that get made on some of the most basic...errrhm fundamental principles. And this is also another principle 
that is so intrinsically linked. Things would all go back down to the basics.

I don't know about this. Sounds like a Debbie Downer to me. It's like he's already setting himself up for the ultimate rejection, when 
all the rejections in the past is the test for the acceptance. Who knows? Maybe this is just cliche. I guess he may be right.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

We're all too familiar with this kind of thing. False pretense. Wrong source. It looks like a meaningful interaction. Looks like the 
jester might be trying to seduce the other guy... a lumberjack? 

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="Gemini_Generated_Image_x6z595x6z595x6z5" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d2b8ce2-3aef-491f-b1d6-ceb927389df9" />

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

So there are these experts sitting there in a room, working, right. And then one of them makes a revelation about some other guy. And 
they're going to act in awe and keep up with their business as usual. Civility over barbarity, upper class over lower class, till the 
break of dawn, whatever that means.

"No good deed goes unpunished" is the tip of the iceberg, and not very meaningful without interpretation. This is what kinda happens 
when people have to make a living through sectarian work. People cannot stay together, but can die alone while also dying together... 
you know... you know that kind of harmonic irony.

She is paying him tribute. Or he is paying her tribute. Sharing is caring, and it pays to have friends. And the scene doesn't look like 
role-playing either. So serious and genuine interaction.

So what if it's a connected and small world? If you don't really think about, it's random for some person to owe another person 
halfway across the world. If you don't really think about, it's not random for colleagues and associates to already be made. Nothing 
much changes with connections, without connections.
