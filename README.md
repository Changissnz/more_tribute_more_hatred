# More Tribute, More Hatred 

Good ol hardy individuals have a right to hate and fight for the right to say it, too. 
Socialists already take hating for granted. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Another case of seeking justice against institutions, against two religions in this one.

After they made him outcast, they decided it was best to drown the airwaves. He must have 
overheard their plan to keep killing him softly.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

Forget Alien vs. Predator. Not realistic enough. Try this one... Cowboy vs. Skinhead. I'm surprised 
Hollywood hasn't made a movie out of the concept yet.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

Those that have never met God but have met goddesses, and maybe that is why. And it's definitely not a narco-terrorist 
conspiracy. Legal doctor. Good doctor. 

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="Gemini_Generated_Image_tl2s9dtl2s9dtl2s (1)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba0d6cb3-5c82-4e21-8ff8-fb3c14640db7" />

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

Talk is so cheap, isn't it? Like, so what? He's in debt to the doctor and doesn't want to pay up. It's not like he has 
any way to solve this human problem. He is bluffing. He is so bluffing. 

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="Gemini_Generated_Image_5apujk5apujk5apu" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8000371e-e993-43af-8244-fbb946e78840" />

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

That's very typical. If you were a kid, it would come as a shock to you the great lengths people go. It looks like this 
man intends for the two to go to greater lengths, to hell.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

A helping hand that surely comes is from an owner that wanted to extend that hand. Once the "real world" hits, no one 
really respects or pays anything more than what they have, anyways.  

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="Gemini_Generated_Image_87fwcy87fwcy87fw" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1eef2c38-923e-41ff-983f-018d4670d9d1" />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

How cogent and strategic. And such beautiful words too, only because it came from a beautiful woman. You know...you know 
how that goes. Reconstruction. Deconstruction. All in one day.  

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="Gemini_Generated_Image_fly48fly48fly48f" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9401d2e-a6ef-4aa5-a0e3-a772b8dd161b" />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

Well, it's not wrong to imagine this. Plenty of low-quality TV shows for example. How do you say, network effect? Legal dramatization? 
De la boca, zu die lieben. 

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="Gemini_Generated_Image_bq20zibq20zibq20" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a76c6f7d-a081-488c-bc87-552f404ebe04" />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

Such humility. Seldom goes unpunished. And it's not as if what he's saying is true. He's probably just a pessimist. And that's why 
he's not rich. Reason. 

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="Gemini_Generated_Image_9lzymj9lzymj9lzy" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d1f874a-8fc7-401a-9be3-d66916039d95" />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

It is big decisions like these that get made on some of the most basic...errrhm fundamental principles. And this is also another principle 
that is so intrinsically linked. Things would all go back down to the basics. 

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="Gemini_Generated_Image_jid3jojid3jojid3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36f05d00-78dc-4ab5-a737-dbd50a2eed80" />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't know about this. Sounds like a Debbie Downer to me. It's like he's already setting himself up for the ultimate rejection, when 
all the rejections in the past is the test for the acceptance. Who knows? Maybe this is just cliche. I guess he may be right. 

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="Gemini_Generated_Image_cqrdlxcqrdlxcqrd" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8421ec50-aaf7-4486-b65a-9e61662ba736" />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

We're all too familiar with this kind of thing. False pretense. Wrong source. It looks like a meaningful interaction. Looks like the 
jester might be trying to seduce the other guy... a lumberjack? 

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="Gemini_Generated_Image_x6z595x6z595x6z5" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d2b8ce2-3aef-491f-b1d6-ceb927389df9" />

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

So there are these experts sitting there in a room, working, right. And then one of them makes a revelation about some other guy. And 
they're going to act in awe and keep up with their business as usual. Civility over barbarity, upper class over lower class, till the 
break of dawn, whatever that means. 

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="Gemini_Generated_Image_xfbvl7xfbvl7xfbv" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2678d36f-2274-40cd-9d99-3e6d51ea6275" />

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

"No good deed goes unpunished" is the tip of the iceberg, and not very meaningful without interpretation. This is what kinda happens 
when people have to make a living through sectarian work. People cannot stay together, but can die alone while also dying together... 
you know... you know that kind of harmonic irony. 

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="Gemini_Generated_Image_jf7e56jf7e56jf7e" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/512b4eaf-ce9d-4ec5-989e-0dcf91c228e3" />

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

She is paying him tribute. Or he is paying her tribute. Sharing is caring, and it pays to have friends. And the scene doesn't look like 
role-playing either. So serious and genuine interaction.  

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="Gemini_Generated_Image_dwgj1gdwgj1gdwgj" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36636584-1a89-4612-a508-7030d131aafb" />

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So what if it's a connected and small world? If you don't really think about, it's random for some person to owe another person 
halfway across the world. If you don't really think about, it's not random for colleagues and associates to already be made. Nothing 
much changes with connections, without connections. 

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="Gemini_Generated_Image_gx68vsgx68vsgx68" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e584463c-734c-4f75-8c6e-f5c68279e62e" />

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

Looks like another day of reports on troublesome people to the Generalismo. I guess "when one door closes, another opens" is in this. 
And the utility of workers, despite the official unemployment, impressive...  

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="Gemini_Generated_Image_j0lmulj0lmulj0lm" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/308b55a8-5629-41d1-abf3-540f4fd2bab7" />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

Is this Illuminati or Anti-Illuminati? And what difference does it make?  

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="Gemini_Generated_Image_i8v1vdi8v1vdi8v1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bee18eca-3acc-4832-b2f8-d6e9374f8639" />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

Sounds accurate on the state of affairs. The whole power in numbers mantra. And that's why when things aren't deliberately rigged, they kinda 
still are. Human stupidity. Or human negligence? 

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="Gemini_Generated_Image_qh2bgjqh2bgjqh2b" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74df4ddf-5bb5-4709-b242-e3590479ac97" />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

Looks like them two are doing fine for themselves. Sleek suits and all. But on that logic, every person that's not on their deathbed is 
technically doing fine. There's no need for more. Modest don't ask. And to ask is to ask for problems. Got it. This is not the world of 
being. This the world of order.

## Part 2: Globalized Perspective  

The crazy thing is don't think that the potential doesn't exist. Also don't think the potential is being used for anything but mostly for inward control. 
Inward control for outward display of perfection. That's the real strategy. 

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="Gemini_Generated_Image_99ege799ege799eg" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0dbcf6d-8e90-4e79-a860-897392043391" />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The global monetary system sure took a few rough patches. They were supposed to be manageable patches, rough but manageable. But things change, 
people move on. What started as a game of catch-up comes to these new things. 

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="Gemini_Generated_Image_edpck8edpck8edpc" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/302a7211-544b-4181-bdf9-a0a91e76187b" />

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

So people still don't always get along nowadays. The Pan-Something movements usually fizzle down sooner rather than later. Maybe it's because of 
the money? But that's just the surface explanation. 

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="Gemini_Generated_Image_6e9jwm6e9jwm6e9j" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b424286a-2be7-424d-8b1d-6ff02a57334e" />

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

People still have their customs and all. Basic labor itself is already a challenge. Maybe the work doesn't get paid. Technology can be dangerous. 
Natural resources is profit is war? Typical lines of thinking. At least give multinational corporations some credit for trying to smooth out the 
rough points. 

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="Gemini_Generated_Image_ue4krfue4krfue4k" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ebda7bc-2fba-429e-9238-a1414b8361bc" />

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

OK. I get that the guy is basically trying to turn his back on one big country to push for another big country. That may come off as offensive to 
some people, but hey... at least give him credit for unorthodox business acumen. 

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="Gemini_Generated_Image_jboio9jboio9jboi" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d726a73a-a616-4881-adbb-97221689d93b" />

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What a bother, right. The barriers everyone goes through. Through thick or thin, there's always some resistance, if not from the top, then from the 
bottom. Fighting to work. Fighting for the brand. For the market share.  

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="Gemini_Generated_Image_1e5u1b1e5u1b1e5u" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f833fe1-70c8-495a-81c6-1bd885d4ee05" />

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

There are these families from different backgrounds, and they all live in one town. Probably a democratic one. And they are all kinda over-competitive 
with each other. An outspoken representative for solidarity has to speak up. Doesn't this look familiar? 

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="Gemini_Generated_Image_h2sbnoh2sbnoh2sb" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c96e5c78-cdc3-4338-b402-3e11a105510c" />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

So that's how the economy has really become in a lot of places in the developed world. And I can't honestly say that it's Protestant modesty. No. It's 
austerity. The austerity is real. 

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="Gemini_Generated_Image_ji6r9iji6r9iji6r" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/533607bd-85d8-453c-b01d-f848bf6e461a" />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

Look at them two. Sharing "cultural dialogue". Resolutions from the other side. Look out, everyone! This player Tommy Chang comes from tough upbringing. 
Shanghai.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

Is this crazy or what? Is the world moving backwards or something? This kinda looks what people keep asking for, these past three centuries. Just saying.  

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="Gemini_Generated_Image_36jm2q36jm2q36jm" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68c3adbb-cf50-4dbc-a21e-8a3b0f6a32b5" />

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

Socialism and family values without borders is nice and all. But if you want the real story, some things are very hard to come together again once conditions 
tear things apart in half.  

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="Gemini_Generated_Image_4c8b8s4c8b8s4c8b" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35179912-bb34-4c15-a7da-2e533696be18" />

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

Such impasse. How some people need all these blessings to move forward. And it's not because they are not independent. It's because they can't be. It's because 
the world is so cold to some people that there's not much room for individual choice.
